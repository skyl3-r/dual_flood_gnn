# DUALFloodGNN

This repository contains the code for "DUALFloodGNN: Physics-informed Graph Neural Networks for Operational Flood Modeling." DUALFloodGNN is a physics-informed flood GNN architecture comprised of three main components: (1) a model that performs shared message passing to predict both node and edge features, (2) a physics-informed loss function that enforces global and local mass conservation between consecutive predictions, and (3) an autoregressive training strategy utilizing dynamic curriculum learning. This paper was accepted at the IJCAI-ECAI 2026 AI4Tech track. Read more about the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23964).

## Setup

### Environment

1. Create a virtual environment (with either conda or venv). This repository has been tested on Python 3.12.3.

```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate # Linux
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # Windows
```

2. Install PyTorch based on your CUDA version. This repository has been tested on PyTorch version 2.5.1. Replace `${CUDA}` with the apporpriate CUDA version for your machine (ex. `${CUDA}` -> 124 for CUDA 12.4).

```bash
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu${CUDA}
```

3. Install PyTorch Geometric based on your PyTorch and CUDA version. Again, replace `${CUDA}` with the apporpriate CUDA version for your machine.

```bash
# Main library
pip install torch_geometric

# Additional libraries
pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.1+cu${CUDA}.html
```

4. Install the remaining dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

The following are the instructions to setup the dataset needed for the repository.

#### HEC-RAS simulation files, Summary files

1. Download the following files from [DOI: 10.25910/9xav-0s86](https://doi.org/10.25910/9xav-0s86).

- HEC-RAS Flood Simulation Files in HDF Format (`HDF_FILES.zip`)
- Dummy train dataset summary file (`train.csv`)
- Dummy test dataset summary file (`test.csv`)

**Note**: DO NOT download the Geometry files from here as they are not updated.

2. Extract the files from `HDF_FILES.zip`. Rename the extracted folder to `HEC-RAS Results`.

#### Updated Geometry files

1. Download the updated geometry files from [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JrIhOoCzYDMZQVtuuKDYvo3wASihmpTt?usp=sharing).
2. Extract the downloaded files. Rename the extracted folder to `GEOMETRY`

#### File Structure

You should now have all all the important files needed for the dataset. These should include the following:
| File | Extension | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Node shape file | .shp | Updated Geometry Files |
| Links shape file | .shp | Updated Geometry Files |
| DEM file | .tif | Updated Geometry Files |
| HEC-RAS simulation files | .hdf | HEC-RAS Simulation Files |
| Summary file for training events | .csv | Summary Files |
| Summary file for testing events | .csv | Summary Files |

1. Create a `raw` folder in the `data/datasets` directory.
2. Place the `HEC-RAS Results` and `GEOMETRY` in the raw data folder created in step 1. Transfer the train.csv and test.csv files to the raw data folder as well. The folder structure should look like this:

```
data/
├── datasets/
│   └── raw/
│       ├── train.csv
│       ├── test.csv
│       ├── GEOMETRY/
│       │   ├── cell_centers_with_ele.shp
│       │   ├── links_with_slope.shp
│       │   ├── DEM.tif
│       │   ...
│       └── HEC-RAS Results/
│           ├── Model_01.p22.hdf
│           ├── Model_01.p23.hdf
│           ...
```

## Running the Code

### Quick Start

To run the training code, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config 'configs/config.yaml' --model 'DUALFloodGNN'
```

Similarly, to run the testing code, use the following command:

```bash
python test.py --config 'configs/config.yaml' --model 'DUALFloodGNN' --model_path 'path/to/model_checkpoint.pt'
```

**IMPORANT**: Make sure train before running tests, as the testing code requires a trained model checkpoint and a processed dataset to perform inference.
